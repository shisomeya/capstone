# Capstone Project: Environmental Chemical Exposures and Disease Outcomes

##Overview

This dashboard explores the association between **environmental chemical exposures**—specifically **BPA**, **phthalates**, and **pesticides**—and disease incidence in racially and ethnically diverse women across the United States.

Interactive visualizations allow users to explore trends, identify linked diseases, and compare health outcomes across different chemicals.
